# Tracking parameters
track_high_thresh: 0.3      # High detection threshold for new tracks
track_low_thresh: 0.05      # Low threshold for second association
new_track_thresh: 0.4       # Threshold to initialize a new track
track_buffer: 45            # Frames to keep lost tracks (higher = longer memory)
